## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The shade states each fact once

*Grounding: the 2026-10-26 design review of native grim captures on the board (`the-shell-and-its-apps-look-finished` design.md).*

<!-- UNVERIFIED: awaits board captures of the fixed build (tasks group 9). -->
The shade SHALL draw its notification count only when there is at least one notification, SHALL centre its empty state in the list column, and SHALL format battery state as "<percent>% · <state>". The keyboard tile SHALL describe its action rather than repeat its title.

#### Scenario: Empty shade
- **WHEN** the shade opens with no notifications
- **THEN** it shows one empty-state message, centred in the list column, and no "0 notifications" line
